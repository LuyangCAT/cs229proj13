This directory contains scripts for generating the data files for the project.

The main data set that we are using is from sander's lab 
(http://www.sananalytics.com/lab/twitter-sentiment/sanders-twitter-0.2.zip)
This contains hand-curated twitter sentiment data. The lab some had people
actually go through and decide whether each tweet was positive or negative
toward the category under which it was grouped. To group the tweets, the lab
used mentions of a few companies of interest (Twitter, Google, Apple, Microsoft)

Because of Twitter's Dev API Terms of Service, tweet data cannot be stored in 
a public repo. Derviative works may refer to the IDs of tweets so that other's
may reconstruct the data set. See the Sander's Lab sentiment taggings for
an example.
